# Outline for Sy-Mail (Gmail/Outlook or any web mail clone)

## Project Overview/Objective
1. Develop a full-stack webmail client that can send & receive emails across domains using standard protocols (SMTP, IMAP/POP3).
2. Integrate a Machine Learning spam detection system to filter junk emails.
3. Implement CI/CD pipelines with DevOps tools for seamless deployment.
4. Deliver a modern, user-friendly UI for the email client.

## Deliverables
1. Mail Server Setup
- Configure Postfix for SMTP mail submission.
- Configure Dovecot for IMAP/POP3 mail retrieval and mailbox management.
- Implement TLS encryption and SPF, DKIM, DMARC for secure email delivery.

2. Web Client (UI/Backend)
- Full MEAN stack app for sign-up, login (JWT/OAuth), inbox, sent items, and email compose.
- REST API endpoints for email CRUD operations and integration with Postfix/Dovecot.
- Frontend using Angular with responsive UI.

3. Spam Filtering (ML Model)
- Train spam filter using Naive Bayes / Scikit-learn on email datasets (Enron dataset or similar).
- Integrate real-time classification pipeline for incoming mail.

4. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Set up Virtual Machine System (AWS EC2 / Azure VM / GCP Compute Engine).
- Containerize services with Docker.
- Orchestrate services with Kubernetes.
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

5. Monitoring & Logging
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for server health and email metrics.
- Implement structured logging and alerting.

- Frontend/Backend: Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- Email Infrastructure: Postfix, Dovecot
- Real-time Messaging & Queues: Kafka (for async notifications or logs)
- ML & Data: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas) for spam detection
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
- Cloud Infra: AWS EC2 / Azure / GCP
